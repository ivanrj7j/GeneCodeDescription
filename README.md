## üì§ Output Format

Returns a JSON object:

```json
{
  "summary": "TP53 is a critical tumor suppressor gene encoding the p53 protein, which regulates cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA repair in response to cellular stress. Mutations in TP53 are extremely common in human cancers and are the primary cause of Li-Fraumeni Syndrome. Its central role makes it a significant target for cancer therapy.",
  "function": {
    "description": "TP53 encodes the p53 protein, a crucial tumor suppressor often called the 'guardian of the genome'. It acts primarily as a transcription factor that responds to cellular stress (like DNA damage, hypoxia, oncogene activation) by regulating genes involved in critical cellular processes to prevent uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation.",
    "actions": [
      "Cell cycle arrest",
      "Apoptosis induction",
      "DNA repair activation",
      "Senescence induction",
      "Metabolic regulation"
    ]
  },
  "importance_in_cancer": {
    "description": "TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene across human cancers. Its inactivation, through mutation or other mechanisms, disrupts critical checkpoints and repair pathways, allowing damaged cells to proliferate and accumulate further mutations, contributing significantly to tumorigenesis and cancer progression.",
    "mutations": "A wide range of mutations occur in TP53, including missense mutations (often in the DNA-binding domain, leading to loss of function or dominant-negative effects), nonsense mutations, frameshifts, and deletions. The specific mutation can influence tumor phenotype and response to therapy."
  },
  "therapeutic_target": {
    "description": "The p53 pathway represents a major target for cancer therapeutics. Strategies focus on restoring wild-type p53 function in tumors where it is mutated or inactivated, or exploiting the consequences of p53 loss to selectively kill cancer cells.",
    "approaches": [
      "Gene therapy (replacing or restoring wild-type p53)",
      "Small molecules to reactivate mutant p53",
      "Drugs targeting downstream pathways affected by p53 loss",
      "Inhibiting proteins that degrade p53 (e.g., MDM2 inhibitors)"
    ]
  },
  "li_fraumeni_syndrome": {
    "description": "Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a rare, inherited cancer predisposition syndrome primarily caused by germline mutations in the TP53 gene. Individuals with LFS have a significantly increased risk of developing a wide spectrum of cancers, often at an early age."
  },
  "conclusion": "TP53 is a cornerstone of genomic stability and a critical tumor suppressor. Its frequent mutation in cancer highlights its importance, making it a key focus for therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring its function or targeting downstream pathways."
}
```
